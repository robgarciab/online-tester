# Online tester (Spring Boot + AngularJS Example)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robgarciab/online-tester.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robgarciab/online-tester)

Basic Java project to show how to integrate an Spring Boot back-end application with an AngularJS front-end. This project is intended to be used as a first template for developers who want to start writing single page applications and donÂ´t want to deal with a task runner tool like [Grunt] or [Gulp] yet.  

###Technology stack:
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Framework
  - JPA (with Hibernate provider)
  - AngularJS
  - Bootstrap
  - Jasmine
  - TestNG
  - Maven

The project also includes TravisCI and Cloudfoundry config files (Cloudfoundry deployment step was commented in .travis.yml file to prevent memory consumption in my pivotal account).

###Maven plugins:
  - Wro4j: This Maven pluggin is used to optimize javascript and css code. Hardcore javascript developers will prefer using a task runner but again for this project I want to avoid using it to reduce the complexity.
  - Jasmine: This Maven plugin make it possible to run Jasmine tests as part of Maven's test phase.

###Maven profiles:
  - Local: To be able to debug javascript code in local environment. The local profiles imports the original javascript and css files.
  - Test: This profile imports the optimized scripts. Same behavior must be used in all shared environments: Test, UAT, Stagging, Prod.

###Authentication:
There are different options to add security to a single page application. For this project I've chosen token based authentication described in this great Spring tutorial: [Spring Security and Angular JS].

###Running the application locally:
Download the code as a zip file from github or clone it to your local machine.
Start the application by running this command: mvn spring-boot:run
Go to [http://localhost:8080]
You can user the following credentials to access: roberto/password or gabriel/password.

Some other sucessful commands:
  - To build the application: mvn install
  - To run jasmine (front-end) tests only: mvn jasmine:test

###Next steps:
  - Take a look to [JHipster]. It's a very useful code generation tool which allows you to create single page applications.
